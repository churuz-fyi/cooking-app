## Environment Setup

Locally install all required packages for development:
```sh
npm install
```

Start the dev environment for the front end:
```sh
npm run dev
```

To use and test anything requiring the API you must make sure you're running the Python Flask App as well. Find it at the [cooking-app-api](https://github.com/churuizramos/cooking-app-api/) repo as well as instructions on how to start it. It requires Python 3.12.

**WARNING** Prerelease is the development branch. Don't work on master. Don't fork from master.
